Welcome to my github portfolio. I am a student in programmation passionated about evolutionnary neural networks and genetic algorithms.

I'll present here lots of interesting jobs and experiments I had the chance to work on.

- Personnal creations around A.I
- Challenging work tasks
- School's projects

For now, you can go check a funny game I made at school : [My Hunter](https://mathematisse.github.io/Portfolio/Docs/Projects/my_hunter.html)

You could also check my two prototypes around NEAT : [GumBot](https://mathematisse.github.io/Portfolio/Docs/Projects/GumBot.html) or [Emergaia](https://mathematisse.github.io/Portfolio/Docs/Projects/Emergaia.html)

Before that, why not check [why NEAT is amazing](https://mathematisse.github.io/Portfolio/Docs/neat.html) ?
